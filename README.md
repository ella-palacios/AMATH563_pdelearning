# That's Op: Learning of Functional Partial Differential Equations Operators in a Data Driven Setting
This repository contains the source code, demo notebooks, and final paper for the term project of AMATH 563: Inferring Structure of Complex Systems at the University of Washington-Seattle. In this project we investigate, reproduce, and extend the results presented in "A Kernel Framework for PDE Discovery and Operator Learning." We considered two basic physical systems -- pendulum and a breaking wave modeled by a viscous Burgers equation -- with training and evaluation on a noisy set of solutions for each, and performing cross-validation to obtain the best performing kernels. We then extended the work to a real-world system given data from NOAA's International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship to explore whether we can reconstruct the trajectories in time of tropical cyclones.  
For further information and results please see our paper, located within the paper/figs folder of this repository.
